      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Our office was established in 1990 in Haymarket, VA.  We moved to our new location in February 2006.  Dr. Ayers is a General Dentist. Our regular patients particularly value Dr. Ayers' years of experience and the family atmosphere of his office .  What is valued most is that each patient feels he or she is the only patient he is treating.  The office does not have that "rushed" feeling so often found in practices today. At Heritage Village Dental, we take the extra step to ensure that you receive the best care possible.</p>

      <p>The office is located at: <b>7120 Heritage Hunt Dr., Heritage Village Plaza, Suite 101, Gainesville, VA  20155</b>.
